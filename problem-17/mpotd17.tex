\begin{document}
A fixed pulley-like device is used to lift a box of mass \( m = 13\text{ kg} \), as shown in figure above. The outer radius of the device is \(R = 7\text{ m} \), and the radius of the hub is \( r = 2\text{ m} \). When a constant horizontal force \( F = 130\text{ N} \) is applied to a rope wrapped around the outer rim of the device, the box hanging from a rope wrapped around the hub acquires an upward acceleration of magnitude \( 2\text{ m/s} \). Then what is the rotational inertia of the device about its axis of rotation? The gravitational acceleration is \( g = 10\text{ m/s}^2 \).
